# Work Item: Area Calculation

## Task Description

You work in an engineering office for surveying technology and have been tasked with developing software for surveying work. We have a surveying device that can measure the distance from one point to another and, in addition to the distance, also measures the angle in degrees (relative to magnetic north). It ignores earth curvature, slopes, inclinations, and the surveying of curves.

## Deliverables

* Define a type for holding the survey data (points with lengths and angles).
* Implement a function that turns these points into x/y coordinates relative to the starting point.
* Implement a function that calculates the area of the plot based on the coordinates.

Fokus on these deliverables. Do not implement additional features or code artifacts on your own.
