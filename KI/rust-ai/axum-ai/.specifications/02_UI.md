# UI

Currently, this demo app contains a fixed AI system prompt and a fixed user input. Additionally, there is no UI yet. We have to change that.

## Functional Requirements

### Rust Backend

* Read the system prompt from a file `system_prompt.md` in the project root.
* Receive the user input in the query string of a GET request to `/chat`.
* You MUST NOT remove the SSE token streaming functionality.

### HTML Frontend

* Change `index.html` so that it contains an input field at the top for the user input and a submit button.
* Display the AI response below the input field in a `pre` block (markdown).
* Use plain JavaScript to receive the SSE token stream and update the `pre` block as new tokens arrive.
* Add line wrapping to the `pre` block (CSS) so that long lines do not cause horizontal scrolling.
* Add decent styling to the page (CSS).
* When the user submits a new question, clear the `pre` block and show the new response there.
