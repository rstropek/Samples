# Deserialization

[01-introduction.md](01-introduction.md) defines the data model of the application.

Create classes and a helper function to deserialize _Permissions_ (only permissions, no users or media assets) from a YAML file. The name or path of the file is passed as an argument to the helper function.

Create a sample YAML file with the examples from [02-introduction.md](02-introduction.md). Concatenate the examples into a single YAML file.

Add a demo usage of the deserialization function to _main.py_ function.
